# AFK-CHECKER
This was made in collaboration of Iheb, Percy, updated by Henom and myself. This is meant to be a stamina packing afk chceker after the rate limit update. An EXE and .py file will be linked here. If you don't want to install python or have issues running the afk checker, use the EXE. The source code (py) file is there to prove that there are no loggers inside the code, and that you may check the code yourself. 

# How to Use
Once you download the EXE or .py file, you will open the afk checker, input your token when prompted, and type "afk check @user 1".

# How to Run Using .Py File
coming soon
